This repository contains my presentation for the [C Book Club for R Contributors](https://github.com/r-devel/c-book-club), a book club meeting for existing/aspiring R contributors that want to learn/refresh their C programming skills that took place in 2023.

You can access my presentation in this [link](https://mcnanton.quarto.pub/c-book-club-for-r-contributors) to read about the capters 8 and 9 from the book [Modern C](https://gustedt.gitlabpages.inria.fr/modern-c/) by Jens Gustedt.
